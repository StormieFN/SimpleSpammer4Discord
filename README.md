# SimpleSpammer4Discord
Simple Python program to spam a custom message with a count-controlled loop and custom cooldown for each.

Install the entire bundle and extract the `.zip` to an accessible directory (Preferably DOWNLOADS or DESKTOP)
Run ``start.bat`` to ensure you have all the dependencies for the Python script.

**Python 3.6 and above if you want to manually install Python (if you already haven't got this downloaded.**
